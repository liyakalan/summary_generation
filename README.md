# Summary Generatiuon

Summary Generation project proposes a front-end web application using HTML and CSS
concepts to create a very basic interface wherein the user can input the text or content of his or
her choice. This will be considered as the original or the raw text. A button is provided thereafter
which on clicking will run the code behind it in the back-end to output the summary text
containing the gist of the original input text. The resulting output will be obviously of a shorter
length as compared to the former.

## Concepts

spaCy: The project has been implemented using the spaCy library which is an alternative
of the NLTK library in Natural Language Processing. The spaCy library offers tokenization,
integrated word vectors, syntactic parsing, etc. This open source library makes it easy to build
systems for information extraction or general purpose NLP.

Flask: Flask is used for developing web applications using python without worrying
about low-level details such as protocol, thread management and so on. It offers flexibility for
developers as it allows them to build a decent web application quickly using only a single python
file.
